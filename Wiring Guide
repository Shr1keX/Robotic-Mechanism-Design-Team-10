This is a wiring guide for what we have going on.

output pins on the Arduino...


PART 1 - arduino and motor controller logic connections
[8,9,10,11,12,13] (all male connectors) 
These connect to the ENA,IN1,IN2 and ENB, EN3,EN4 MALE connectors on the motor controller.

ENA,IN1,IN2: motor A
ENA,IN1,IN2: motor B

It doesn't matter if Left/Right get mixed up, that can be fixed in the code.

ENA = 11
ENB = 10
These are the PWM supplies

IN1 = 8
IN2= 9
These control motor A

IN3 =12
IN4 =13
These control motor B

PART 2 - Arduino and motor controller power relations
Connect the Vin on the Arduino to the 5V power output on the motor controller
Connect one of the grounds on the arduino (Doesn't matter which) to the Grounnd connection on the motor controller

PART 3 - Arduino and Joystick  relations
Connect the Arduino A0 and A1 pins to the joystick (It's ok if you mix these up, the code is easy to tweak) 
Connect an Arduino ground to the joystick ground
OPTIONAL:
connect an arduino dc input to the button ( haven't set this up yet)
Just use that last pin on the joystick and i have it hooked up to pin 7 on the arudino

PART 4 - 9V battery relations
The positive lead goes to the motor controller power input, the negative lead goes to the third arduino ground. 

PART 5 - the motors hook up to the side terminals on the motor controller, idk the order check the thing on the slides, you can probably just fuck w it.
